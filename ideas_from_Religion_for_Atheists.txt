 - Scripted social interactions. In particular social interactions that take us beyond the stereotypical "what do you do for work?" questions and to things that really matter.
 - Should also get people to mix and interact with others outside of the normal "tribe" that they would normally choose to interact with.
 - Should remind us that we are all imperfect and that being imperfect is ok.
 - Should encourage us to forgive and to be forgiven.
 - Should allow some sort of release or channel of our darker impulses--at the very least to acknowledge that they exist.
 - Should repeat key information and key truths. Should give a STRUCTURE to this repetition that is easy to make into a habit.

"Religions understand the value of training our minds with a rigour thatwe are accustomed to applying only to the training of our bodies. Theypresent us with an array of spiritual exercises designed to strengthen ourinclination towards virtuous thoughts and patterns of behaviour: they situs down in unfamiliar spaces, adjust our posture, regulate what we eat,give us scripts detailing what we should say to one another and minutelymonitor the thoughts that cross our consciousness. They do all this not inorder to deny us freedom but to quell our anxieties and flex our moralcapacities.This double insight – that we should train our minds just as we trainour bodies, and that we should do so partly through those bodies – hasled to the founding, by all the major faiths, of religious retreats whereadherents may for a limited time abscond from their ordinary lives andfind inner restoration through spiritual exercise." - p 115

"No existing mainstream secular institution has a declared interest inteaching us the art of living. To draw an analogy from the history ofscience,  the  ethical  field  is  at  the  stage  of  amateurs  tinkering  withchemicals in garden sheds rather than that of professionals conductingwell-structured  experiments  in  research  laboratories" - p 128
