Areas of focus for Evolutionism (finances):

 - 10% investments. Need long-term income to become powerful enough to change human history.
 - 9% administrative. Employees, new ideas, etc. Political lobbying also falls here, unless it's not possible (need to keep tax-exempt staus!)
 - 19% humanitarian. Our humanitarian work needs to be serious, given to all (Evolutionists get no special consideration. Programs for members are a different category.), and oriented to humanity.
 - 29% R&D. This includes backing companies which have the goal of increasing human survival potential. Also includes founding and maintaining a university, and funding different research projects designed to better the human condition.
 - 19% Child care network and child care resources. Also health care resources for poor people.
 - 14% Other programs for members. Expansion of meetinghouses, psychological help, retreats, etc.

Alignment with the Plan of Progress:
1) Understand yourself. (Programs for members, psych help and resources)
2) Participate in the bearing and raising of the next generation. (Child care network, counseling and resources for couples, resources on sexuality)
3) Increase human survival potential in the short term by alleviating human suffering and increasing human happiness. (Humanitarian)
4) Increase human survival potential in the long term by striving for Transcendence. (R&D)

Administrative helps make sure our surrent expeditures are meeting their goals and tries to anticipate how the future will necessitate changes. Investments will give us more power over time to fulfill all our goals, as well as Special projects that maight be taken up in the future.







Plans for focus areas
University
Name: Institute for the Study of Human Progress
Should be private, coed, etc. Try to make it large: allow for as many students as possible. Goal: 30-50k. With more via online classes.

Core Curriculum
A: Plan of Progress Focus Courses
 1) Foundations of Evolutionism. Basically a class about what Evolutionism is and means, how they are citizens of humanity/agents of evolution with an obligation to contribute, etc. This is a seminar-type class; 1 credit hour.
 2) Human Evolution requirement. Could be Human Evolution, Evolutionary Psychology, Evolutionary Biology, etc.
 3) Cultural Evolution requirement. Needs to study cultures, how they've changed over time, with a perspective on what's improved and why. How to sustain the good changes.
 4) Human sexuality and child-rearing requirement. Take one or the other. Strongly considering mandating both though.
 5) Ethics/civics requirement. Ethical issues and philosophies.
 6) Service project requirement. Need a certain number of hours.
 7) Transcendence project. Like the service project, this isn't a traditional class. This is a well-written paper where the student grapples with how their life will improve the survival potential of humanity and what their contribution is/will be on the road to transcendence.

B: Skills
 1) Statistics.
 2) Personal Finance. 2 credit hours
 3) Life and coping skills. 2 credit hours. These should be based in the current scientific/psychological literature.
 4) Writing.

C: Areas of Learning
 1) Art and Literature. As broad as it sounds.
 2) Culture/Social Science (Can be doubled with Cultural Evolution). Psychology, sociology, foreign language, religion, etc.
 3) Mathematics (Needs to be at the intro calculus level. All students need to know intro-level calculus.)
 4) Biological Science (Can be doubled with Human Evolution with the right class). Intro to Biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, etc.

Childcare network
 - Need to staff with people who have minimum bachelor's degree in early childhood education. Pay them well; $50k minimum salary.
 - Needs to be grounded in current research about how to help children grow, develop, and thrive.
 - Children should be given social time with other children and with adult caregivers.
 - Abuse reports investigated thoroughly. Abuse is not tolerated in any form.
 - Cost based on parental income. Try to subsidize this heavily if possible.



Programs for members
 - Weekly evening classes on personal finance, job skills, psychological/coping skills. Include meditiation & mindfulness here.
 - Group therapy sessions if applicable.
 - Addiction help programs.
 - Individual and marriage counseling.
 - Youth retreats. Partner with Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts.
 - Nature retreats. Away from civilization, minimum 1 week.
 - Resources on sexuality for individuals and couples. What is healthy sexuality? How can I be sexually healthy? How can I support the sexual health of my partner?
 - Additional job and employment skills.
 - Service projects in the community on evenings/weekends.
 - These are open to members first, but if there is room for more, anyone is welcome. Try to invite the general public as much as possible.
 - None of these are required; they are help if agents want to get involved or need help with life challenges.



Humanitarian work
 - Based on the needs of communities of agents, and of the world.
 - Ask for agents to give a few hours a month and a certain % of income to humanitarian work. They can give to any organization, not just to Evolutionism-sponsored orgs.
 - Agents with very young children (less than 3) get a pass! Raising their children is their service project. Children can start to help from a young age though and should be brought to service projects when possible.
 - Teaching the classes in "Programs for Members" is considered to fulfill the service hours as well. Teachers should be qualified; i.e. some kind of certificate in the area they teach, or recognized skill in that area (ex. a multimillionaire ought to be ok to teach a class on personal finance)
 - Sponsor service trips for youth, sort of like missions or "mission trips" performed by Christian youth. Couples who wish to go on these should be welcomed!
 - Basic health resources for poor people.
