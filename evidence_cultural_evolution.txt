"The  environment,  obviously,  plays  a  crucial  role  in  natural  selection.  I’m reminded of this fact when I remember the iconic Greek fishing villages of my youth. As I grew older and traveled more widely, I was puzzled to discover what looked like Greek fishing villages in all kinds of unexpected locations: Nova Scotia, Hong Kong, Brazil, California. The layout of the brightly colored houses, the  boats  and  nets  and  traps  next  to  the  living  quarters,  the  little  dockside tavernas, and the narrow, winding roads—it all felt so familiar to me. It seemed that  everyone  wanted  to  build  a  Greek  fishing  village.  Then  I  realized  that fishing  villages  converge  on  similar  plans  because  they  all  serve  the  same functions: to allow people to launch boats into the water with relative ease, to return  safely  with  their  catch,  to  maintain  materials  in  salty,  windy,  and  wet conditions, and to cope with the hazards of living near the sea." -Christakis, Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society, p. 256

"There is also widespread experimental  evidence  that  groups,  especially  heterogeneous groups,  outperform  individuals  in  tasks  of problem solving or  decision  making  (Garrod  and  Doherty  1994;  Moshman and Geil 1998; Schulz Hardt et al. 2000), again suggesting that more variation is generated on which selection can then act." - PERSPECTIVE:IS HUMAN CULTURAL EVOLUTION DARWINIAN? EVIDENCE REVIEWED FROM THEPERSPECTIVE OFTHE ORIGIN OF SPECIES Mesoudi et al, Evolution,58(1), 2004, pp. 1–11

This quote is extremely important. It demonstrates the principle that variation in thinking and behavior is a human ADVANTAGE. If individuals can think and act differently, each individual can solve a (slightly?) different set of problems. (the principle of comparative advantage in economics) This is a related principle, which is that a heterogeneous group of humans (i.e. agroup of individuals who think and act at least somewhat differently) is more efficient at solving a SINGLE difficult problem than an individual. There is strong experimental evidence for this.

Christakis end of chapter 9, and chapter 10/11 have a lot about cultural evolution. This is important.
