*** The HISTORY will be the hardest book in the canon to write, as it has to be absolutely true to the science but also tell it in a symbolic way that anthropomorphizes Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, Evolution, and Probability, and is actually fun to read unlike most accounts ***

In the beginning, the universe inflated. 

From what? Did anything else exist before this "beginning"? These are questions that may never be answered by mortal humanity. Indeed, we may never know if the Great Divinity, Natural Law, which governs this universe, was created from a more primal Natural Law which exists outside of it. But this we do know, that for us, this was the beginning, and there exists no time before it. For time itself came into being with the universe, and where there is no time, there is no "before."

Therefore, in the beginning, the universe inflated, and from the beginning it was governed by Natural Law. For:

Natural Law governs nature,
All is nature, and
Nature is in all.

As the eons passed, the children of Natural Law took shape and governed each their own domain of nature, or of all that is. First came Physics and Mathematics, twins who share a fondness for abstraction and ruling from afar. Mathematics never visits the universe, but stays always in her tower in the pursuit of further knowledge, ever reading, never satisified. She exercises her power through decrees which constrain the action of the other deities. Few understand her, all repsect her, and for most, that respect is tinged with fear. But Physics, her brother, loves her most, and though he is always in and around the universe, shares her love of methodical planning. He is always calculating the outcome of any interaction of forms, and knows the answer before anyone else can know it. Then came the son of Mathematics, Probability, impetuous, fleeting. All deities, all mortal beings, and all that is must consult Probability in all their decisions. And when asked for a decision, Probability throws his head back wildly and laughs, then renders his judgment, and his judgment may not be altered.

***OLD VERSION. TAKE WHAT I CAN FROM THIS.***
As the point expanded, pure energy began to assume new forms, strange and wonderful: Radiation, particles, MATTER. The various aspects of Natural Law were divided into their domains: Physics, in the domains of mechanics, electromagnetism, nuclear forces, and so on; Chemistry, in the domains of bonding, reactions, organics/inorganics, and so on; Mathematics, in the domains of algebra, analysis, logic and patterns, and so on. And these aspects governed each one its own domain, with its own laws.

Eons passed, and there came a time when Physics compressed matter into planets, and upon one or more of those planets--for who can know the extent of the universe and the works of Natural Law?--Chemistry formed a New Thing: SELF-REPLICATION. A new kind of molecule arose that could replicate itself.\footnote{We believe this molecule to be the first RNA, but its precise nature is still uncertain. Yet its existence is established by the fact that it was a necessary precursor for our own.} Once the New Thing began to replicate itself, which was a trait seen nowhere else in the universe, it was awarded the highest honor Natural Law could grant: it was governed by an entirely new aspect, Biology. 

As the copies of this new molecule multiplied it became clear that not all the copies were the same. The son of Mathematics, Probability, gave different circumstances varying chances of preserving or destroying these copies. And then the daughter of Biology began to use that to her advantage. The better-preserved copies could continue to better preserve themselves under similar cicrumstances. Slight modifications to the copies might cause them to survive and replicate even more wonderfully. But Biology's daughter understood that the process was so complex that she had no hope of calculating, a priori, which modifications would be beneficial and which would consign their bearers to certain destruction. Judging that the chance for beneficial modifications was worth the risk of harmful ones, she began to test all possible modifications as a scientist tests all possible hypotheses. Some were utter failures, but some produced results so wonderful they exceeded her wildest expectations. This taking-advantage of the whims of Probability earned Biology's daughter a sacred name: Evolution. It was another New Thing: IMPROVEMENT THROUGH CHANGE.

Over the eons, under Evolution's guidance, the self-replicating molecules became collections of molecules that could replicate the entire collection. These collections were the first cells, and they were the first truly living things. These cells eventually became differentiated into groups that preferred intercourse among members of the group rather than between groups. These groups were the first species. And Evolution gave to each species a Prime Directive: To increase its own Survival Potential, or its ability to survive no matter what circumstances Probability could concoct. Evolution did this not to force species into competition with one another, since competition is a product of scarce or finite resources rather than of the ability to survive. If resources were infinite then all species would survive in peaceful coexistence and new species would simply learn to survive by learning to better utilize the natural abundance with which they were endowed. Rather Evolution's purpose was that each might develop in its own way, and that she might marvel in the beauty of variety that would result.  

As the eons passed, life continued to evolve into new forms, strange and wonderful: plants, animals, fungi. But the changes were slow. Evolution could work only through modification of genes, which modified physical characteristics and instincts. In turn, instincts modified responses to stimuli. But instinct is slow to change, and when instinct does not change to meet new circumstances, suffering and death are the results. But Evolution's constant struggle for improvement produced another New Thing: REASON. When reason came to be, a living being could evaluate a stimulus and <i>learn what the consequences would be.</i> Creatures that could learn consequences could learn to pursue or avoid those consequences, and for the creatures with brains of sufficient complexity, this advantage was so great as to render it necessary for survival.

It has been asserted by a wise man that instinct is the best way that nature, that is, Evolution, could have provided for a species to respond correctly to stimuli in order to ensure its continued survival. But this is false, for the simple reason that the circumstances and stimuli change faster than instinct. There is a better, faster way for a species to learn to adapt to new circumstances, and that way is reason. 

But a flaw was still found with reason: each living creature had to learn the consequences of stimuli for itself. Those that died with full experience took their knowledge with them so that much effort was wasted in relearning long-discovered consequences. Suffering and needless death were the results. Then Evolution made another New Thing to remedy this flaw: TRANSMISSION OF KNOWLEDGE, or COMMUNICATION. Now beings could share their knowledge of stimuli with each other. The young could learn from the old, and avoid the fate suffered by those that had once been young but would never be old.
